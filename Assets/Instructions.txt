You have the ability to control a group of characters, one at a time, for a period of 10 seconds.
The same 10 seconds.
After running one character through the 10 seconds, you can then select another.
The objectives for each level are given on the left hand side of the screen.
Arrows/pad/WASD for movement (minimum movement one tile)
Fire 1/Ctrl to Interact with a button or similar, or to pick up/put down an item (you cannot use bottons while holding an item)
Fire 2/Alt to use the held item - eg, to swing an axe or use a fire extinguisher.
Mouse to select which character to use - selectable characters will be highlighted in green.

Apologies for any lack of clarity. Lack of sleep is begginning to tell.
